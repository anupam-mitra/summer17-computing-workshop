<div class="home">

<p>This lesson used a Jupyter notebook to introduce the idea of code vectorization, with
the specific application of simulating a (classical) random walk. The notebook may be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/CQuIC/summer17-computing-workshop/tree/master/Parallelization">here</a>, and may be viewed <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CQuIC/summer17-computing-workshop/blob/master/Parallelization/Random_Walk_Simulator-Vectorization.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
