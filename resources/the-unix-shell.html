<p>The shell lesson was taken from Software Carpentry:
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">swcarpentry lesson</a>.
There are many useful things in the lesson we were unable to cover, so I highly
recommend perusing it on your own.</p>

<p>If you are curious to learn about the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (which
provides guidelines concerning where different kinds of files ought to reside
within a Unix directory structure), its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Wikipedia
page</a> is a good place to start.</a>

<p>The terminal session for our lesson was saved to the text file <a
href="../files/the-unix-shell.txt">the-unix-shell.txt</a>, This file may look
strange in your browser, as it includes many special characters that
communicate things to the terminal, so I've also used <a
href="http://www.andre-simon.de/">ansifilter</a> to format the output in HTML,
which you can view <a href="../files/the-unix-shell.html">here</a> (the nano
sessions still look strange, but I don't think that can be helped).</p>

<p>I additionally recorded the session to the JSON file <a
href="../files/the-unix-shell.json">the-unix-shell.json</a> using <a
href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> You may download the recording and
play it on your own machine, or view it on the <a
href="https://asciinema.org/a/3r7w6z7nqe7gagjeg7wt1a8fu">asciinema website</a>.
