<div class="home">

<p>This lesson used a Jupyter notebook to introduce the basics of mpi4py. It also involved writing several text files
which could be executed using MPI. The files may be viewed and downloaded <a href="https://github.com/CQuIC/summer17-computing-workshop/tree/master/Parallelization/mpi4py">here</a>. The notebook may be viewed online <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CQuIC/summer17-computing-workshop/blob/master/Parallelization/mpi4py/Introduction_to_MPI4py.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
