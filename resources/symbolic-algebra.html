<p>The symbolic algebra lesson was loosly base on the <a
  href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/">sympy tutorial</a>.  There are
many useful things in the tutorial we were unable to cover, so I highly
recommend perusing it on your own.</p>

<p>The completed jupyter notebook for the lesson is available on <a
  href='https://github.com/jarthurgross/symbolic-algebra-lesson'>github</a> and
can be viewed on <a
  href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jarthurgross/symbolic-algebra-lesson/blob/master/symbolic-algebra.ipynb'>nbviewer.jupyter.org</a>.</p>
